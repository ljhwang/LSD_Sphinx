# Seismic Patrimony

Resources on working with analog seimsic data

## Seismic Patrimony Tutorial
Maria Teresa Merino, Josep Batlló, and Tana Andrades have been developing a tutorial detailing several aspects of the of the preservation and restoration of legacy seismic archives. While this currently remains a work in progress, it contains a wealth of information likely to be useful for seismic observatories and institutes facing the challenge of managing. <br>

## New Manual of Observatory Practices
The New Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (NMSOP) is a compendium of seismological knowledge needed to run observatories
and seismic network. NMSOP facilitates the use of data acquired by (digital) seismic networks. 
A new chapter by Josep Batlló and R. de Plaen is in beta to give users 
 of analog seismograms a basic knowledge about the main characteristics of the records and
help them to properly digitize them. This includes a review of analog seismogram morphology, time accuracy and time corrections, instrument transfer function
determination and needed trace corrections for digitization.
