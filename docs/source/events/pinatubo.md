# 1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines

Data set consists of scanned seismic drum records recorded at Mount Pinatubo between April 30 and June 17, 1991. The archive contains 145 drum records that recorded seismicity associated with the 1991 eruptions. These drum records are the only continuous seismic records produced from a local network of seismic stations. The images of the drum records are in PDF format.
