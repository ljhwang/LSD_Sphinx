# Legacy Seismic Data

This document is a community project. We depend on contributions from community members who maintain and use collections of legacy data.

We welcome all contributions including but not limited to:
* Corrections, updates, and addition to content
* New content and features
* Suggestions for improvements

These maybe submitted as
* an github issue
* pull request

## Where to find files for:
 **Stations, Organizations, and Monitoring**  
 All markdown files are found in the folder */docs/source.*

 **Station Locations**  
Station locations data is currently only available through the [orignal website](https://github.com/ljhwang/Legacy-Seismic-Data.io). This data will be added once new maps are created. 

The current html maps do not work.


## Adding new files
When adding new Station, Organization, or Monitoring files, the following needs to be updated and added, remember to update the appropriate index.md file
* To add to drop down menu, update *_data/navigation.yml*
* Place all images in */images*
* Add any references to *resources/references.md*.  See Zotero for [publications](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4376905/legacy_seismic_data) tht use legacy data.
